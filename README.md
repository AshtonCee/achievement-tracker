# achievement-tracker

A program that takes the name of a game and finds all the achievements for it, lists it out, and puts a checkbox next to it in order to keep track of which ones have been completed.
Plan on adding saving features + saving between different games + selecting different games.
First time GUI practice as well with this one.
